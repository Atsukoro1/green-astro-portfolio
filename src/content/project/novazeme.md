# Project: NovaZeme - Encrypted Community Planning Application

## Introduction
In the realm of technology, innovation often leads to solutions that enhance community interactions. The project at hand is an end-to-end encrypted mobile application linked to a web server, designed to streamline planning activities for individuals within small village-scaled communities. This application boasts a built-in planning system that simplifies the process of offering unique commodities to others within the community.

## Technologies Used
The project leverages a robust tech stack to deliver its functionalities:
- Express.js
- React Native
- Expo
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js

## Website Structure
The website is thoughtfully structured to cater to the needs of users within these communities:
1. **Login Page**: Users can create new communities or join existing ones by scanning a QR code that contains essential encryption key information for secure data decryption.
2. **Main Page**: This central hub offers a range of buttons enabling community members to select various actions.
3. **Commodities Page**: Here, users can engage in offering and exchanging commodities with others in the community. For instance, one could propose trading 2 carrots for 1 potato.

This project embodies the essence of community collaboration and efficient resource sharing through a secure and user-friendly platform.
